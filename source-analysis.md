# Source analysis (Individual Assignment)

Delete this introductory material when submitting your assignment
Locate a digital source that is related to you (or your group's) general research aims. I will allow a generous leeway in terms of how much the source relates to your final topic, so even a source that is indirectly related is acceptable for now. Remember, although researches start off with a topic of interest, they nearly always end up changing their questions.

This exercise is designed to (a) get you thinking critically about an digital source and (b) what are the possibilities and problems of using that source to illuminate your possible research interests. If in the process of doing your source analysis you realize that your research interest might need significant reworking, that is okay. I expect everyoneâ€™s topics to change over the course of the semester. The aim of this exercise is to teach you to think about how to approach *any* digital source.

Overall, your answers should be *roughly* the equivalent of 2 pages, double-spaced.

See the [README.md](README.md) file for information on how to submit this assignment.

## Authorship

* Is there any information available discussing the process by which the information was gathered, or how the digital project was constructed?
* How transparent is the project about the choices they made in gathering and transforming the data for digitalization? [Click here for an example of a an excellent 'About' page from a database about Anglo-Saxons](http://www.pase.ac.uk/about/index.html)
* Do the organizations or individuals involved in gathering and publishing your data set have any stated goals or agendas?
* Do the organizations or individuals involved seem to have any unstated agendas or goals?
* If a 3rd party funded the project, who are they? Do they have any particular perspective?

## Data Analysis

* Do the datasets involved reflect the viewpoints of particular groups or institutions, and if so, who?
* What kinds of categorizations do you find in the data, and do they seem reasonable?
* Do the means of data collection or categorization affect how the data is constructed in any way?
* Does the website contain any tools for visualizing the data? Do they seem like they are making any kind of arguments?
